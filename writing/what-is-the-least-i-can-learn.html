            <p>I am in recovery from a condition that I would call &quot;knowledge FOMO&quot;.</p>
            <p>What does this look like?</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Studying the French Revolution just so I can beat my girlfriend in Jeopardy</li>
            <li>Trying to resist but ultimately giving in to primo YouTube clickbait every time (my watch later list is currently sitting at 3143 videos)</li>
            <li>There was no sadder moment for me than the first time I looked at my bookshelf and admitted to myself &quot;there are some books in here I will never, ever read&quot;</li>
            <li>Taking 5x too long on projects because I need to know what everything means and how everything works</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A recent example from motorcycle maintenance:
            I couldn&#39;t just use the grease the manual suggested for the rear axle, I had to know what all types of grease exist, why this one is used for this application, how bad it would be to substitute a different one, what is really the difference between grease and lubricant, etc etc etc. </p>
            <p>Now some might say to themselves reading that: &quot;wow what a curious young man, how good it is to know the &#39;why&#39; and not just blindly follow like sheep.&quot; I say that because I&#39;ve heard that. I think its part of why I justified it for so long. It&#39;s <em>useful</em> and <em>admirable</em> to know things, right?</p>
            <p>No, not right. Knowing things is only useful if we do something with it. In the motorcycle example, I ultimately used the dumb grease the manual suggested. I knew I would all along. It&#39;s cheap, easy to find, and it&#39;s pretty safe to assume the manual man knows his stuff.[^1] Nowhere in this knowledge adventure was there any other motivation besides some vague internal sense of &quot;gotta know it&quot; and a visualization of the pride on my dad&#39;s face when he pop quizzes me out of nowhere on automobile grease and I get a 105.</p>
            <p>So how do we learn responsibly? In a way that&#39;s <em>actually</em> useful?</p>
            <p>Well, rather than knowledge being the goal, let it just be one of the tools available to you to reach your <em>actual</em> goals. I can think of about 100,000 goals I&#39;d rather reach than proactively preparing myself for my dad&#39;s maintenance pop quizzes (this isn&#39;t something that actually happens idk where this idea came from my dad takes his motorcycle to the shop like a normal person), but if I&#39;m not consciously thinking about them then these random urges can easily take precedence. If I <em>am</em> consciously thinking about them then I realize what I&#39;m really missing out on and can redirect that FOMO in a more healthy direction. This is one of the main reasons explicit goals are <em>essential</em> and the effort towards setting them right is always worth it. A well set goal equips you with a &quot;what should I learn&quot; detector.</p>
            <p>And for those of us who <em>really</em> struggle with the knowledge hunger, I suggest a slightly more extreme measure: Ask yourself &quot;What is the least I can learn to accomplish this goal?&quot;</p>
            <p>This question forces us to confront the fact that learning is actually an <em>obstacle</em> to our goals. It&#39;s something that will use some of our finite human energy. It&#39;s like this common reminder in the software industry for people who get too in love with writing code for the sake of writing code: &quot;Code is not an asset, it&#39;s a liability.&quot;  </p>
            <p>But this is good news! We don&#39;t have to learn any less than we used to. It&#39;s just that now we can reach way more fulfilling goals way more often while we&#39;re doing it! All it takes is a lil bit of good ole fashioned planning and discipline.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>[^1]: Just want to mention that I&#39;m overly harsh on undirected learning to make a point, but really, curiosity as self care is a super valid motivation. I do like knowing about the different greases. It was fun. they are all different colors. I want to collect them all like useful Pokemon cards.</p>
