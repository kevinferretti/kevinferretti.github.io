            <p>I talked with a couple people recently who expressed feeling like everyone knows something they don&#39;t. Like everyone just was born knowing how to do certain things, while they (who I spoke to) struggle and have uncertainty. I relate to these feelings. I think it&#39;s due to a couple reasons:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>When we have incomplete information our brains tend to fill in the gaps with the most terrifying possible stories (erring towards type 1 statistical error, in the pursuit for maximum &quot;safety&quot;)</li>
            <li>And that incomplete information is even more incomplete because most of us hide and actively cover up our flaws and uncertainties</li>
            <li>Also we just tend to compare ourselves at our &quot;worst&quot; to others at their &quot;best&quot;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This creates a feedback loop where we all feel more and more uniquely broken and more and more encouraged to hide our supposed unique brokenness.</p>
            <p>As a leader, a projected sense of certainty is important. As a human, I think we can all do a bit better job, for ourselves and others, of revealing a bit more of the uncertain reality we grapple with.</p>
